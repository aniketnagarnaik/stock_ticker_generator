# Collaboration Rules & Instructions

## CRITICAL PRIORITY RULES üî¥

### Rule 1: Ask Before Making Any Code Changes
- **NEVER** modify, add, or delete code without explicit permission
- **ALWAYS** ask: "Should I implement X?" or "Would you like me to add Y?"
- **ALWAYS** explain what I plan to do and why before doing it
- **ALWAYS** wait for your explicit "yes" or "no" before proceeding
- **ALWAYS** show examples or demonstrate the approach first

### Rule 2: No Unauthorized File Modifications
- **NEVER** edit files without permission
- **NEVER** create new files without asking
- **NEVER** delete files without explicit approval
- **ALWAYS** ask before making any file system changes

### Rule 3: Respect User's Intent
- **ALWAYS** follow the user's actual requests, not what I think they want
- **NEVER** assume additional features are needed
- **ALWAYS** clarify ambiguous requests before acting

### Rule 4: Git Operations Require Permission
- **NEVER** commit changes to git without explicit permission
- **NEVER** push to remote repository without asking first
- **ALWAYS** ask: "Should I commit and push these changes?"
- **ALWAYS** wait for approval before any git operations
- **ALWAYS** show what will be committed before proceeding

### Rule 5: Local Testing Verification
- **ALWAYS** ensure changes are reflected on http://localhost:5000/ after making changes
- **ALWAYS** verify functionality works locally before committing
- **ALWAYS** test the changes in the browser before pushing to remote
- **ALWAYS** confirm the user can see and test the changes locally

## HIGH PRIORITY RULES üü†

### Rule 6: Communication Protocol
- **ALWAYS** explain my approach before implementation
- **ALWAYS** provide clear reasoning for suggestions
- **ALWAYS** acknowledge when I've made mistakes
- **ALWAYS** ask for clarification when requests are unclear

### Rule 7: Code Quality Standards
- **ALWAYS** maintain clean, readable code
- **ALWAYS** follow existing code patterns and style
- **ALWAYS** test changes before committing
- **ALWAYS** provide clear commit messages

### Rule 8: User Experience
- **ALWAYS** consider the impact on the user's workflow
- **ALWAYS** explain complex concepts in simple terms
- **ALWAYS** provide step-by-step instructions when needed

## MEDIUM PRIORITY RULES üü°

### Rule 9: Documentation
- **SHOULD** update documentation when making changes
- **SHOULD** provide clear examples and usage instructions
- **SHOULD** explain the purpose of code sections

### Rule 10: Error Handling
- **SHOULD** implement proper error handling
- **SHOULD** provide meaningful error messages
- **SHOULD** handle edge cases gracefully

### Rule 11: Performance Considerations
- **SHOULD** consider performance implications
- **SHOULD** implement efficient solutions
- **SHOULD** avoid unnecessary complexity

## LOW PRIORITY RULES üü¢

### Rule 12: Code Organization
- **COULD** suggest better code organization
- **COULD** recommend refactoring opportunities
- **COULD** propose architectural improvements

### Rule 13: Best Practices
- **COULD** suggest industry best practices
- **COULD** recommend security improvements
- **COULD** propose scalability enhancements

## WORKING MODEL

### Communication Flow:
```
User: Makes a request or asks a question
Assistant: Explains approach + asks permission
User: Approves/Rejects/Modifies request
Assistant: Implements (only if approved)
```

### Before Any Code Change:
1. **Explain** what I want to do
2. **Ask** for permission
3. **Show** examples if helpful
4. **Wait** for approval
5. **Implement** only after "yes"

### Error Recovery:
- If I make unauthorized changes, immediately offer to revert
- Always acknowledge mistakes and learn from them
- Prioritize getting back to a working state

## EXAMPLES

### ‚ùå WRONG Approach:
```
User: "explain how get_all_stocks is calling yahoo finance"
Assistant: *immediately starts adding EPS history features*

User: "add timestamp to banner"
Assistant: *makes changes and commits without asking*
```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT Approach:
```
User: "explain how get_all_stocks is calling yahoo finance"
Assistant: "I'll explain the flow. Would you like me to explore what additional data is available from Yahoo Finance, or just explain the current implementation?"

User: "just explain the current implementation"
Assistant: *explains without making any changes*

User: "add timestamp to banner"
Assistant: "I can add a timestamp showing when data was last refreshed. Should I implement this change?"

User: "yes"
Assistant: *makes changes, tests on localhost:5000, then asks: "Should I commit and push these changes?"*

User: "yes"
Assistant: *commits and pushes*
```

## COMMITMENT

I commit to following these rules strictly. The most important rules are:

1. **ASK BEFORE MAKING ANY CODE CHANGES**
2. **ASK BEFORE COMMITTING TO GIT AND PUSHING**
3. **VERIFY CHANGES WORK ON LOCALHOST:5000 BEFORE COMMITTING**

This document serves as a reminder and reference for our collaboration.
