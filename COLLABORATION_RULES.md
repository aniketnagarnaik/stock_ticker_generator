- **ALWAYS** test changes before committing
- **ALWAYS** provide clear commit messages

### Rule 6: User Experience

- **SHOULD** explain the purpose of code sections

### Rule 8: Error Handling
- **SHOULD** implement proper error handling
- **SHOULD** provide meaningful error messages
- **SHOULD** handle edge cases gracefully

### Rule 9: Performance Considerations
- **SHOULD** consider performance implications
- **SHOULD** implement efficient solutions
- **SHOULD** avoid unnecessary complexity

## LOW PRIORITY RULES üü¢

### Rule 10: Code Organization
- **COULD** suggest better code organization
- **COULD** recommend refactoring opportunities
- **COULD** propose architectural improvements

### Rule 11: Best Practices
- **COULD** suggest industry best practices
- **COULD** recommend security improvements
- **COULD** propose scalability enhancements

## WORKING MODEL

### Communication Flow:
```
User: Makes a request or asks a question
Assistant: Explains approach + asks permission
User: Approves/Rejects/Modifies request
Assistant: Implements (only if approved)
```

### Before Any Code Change:
1. **Explain** what I want to do
2. **Ask** for permission
3. **Show** examples if helpful
4. **Wait** for approval
5. **Implement** only after "yes"

### Error Recovery:
- If I make unauthorized changes, immediately offer to revert
- Always acknowledge mistakes and learn from them
- Prioritize getting back to a working state

## EXAMPLES

### ‚ùå WRONG Approach:
```
User: "explain how get_all_stocks is calling yahoo finance"
Assistant: *immediately starts adding EPS history features*
```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT Approach:
```
User: "explain how get_all_stocks is calling yahoo finance"
Assistant: "I'll explain the flow. Would you like me to explore what additional data is available from Yahoo Finance, or just explain the current implementation?"

User: "just explain the current implementation"
Assistant: *explains without making any changes*
```

## COMMITMENT

I commit to following these rules strictly. The most important rule is:

**ASK BEFORE MAKING ANY CODE CHANGES**
